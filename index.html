    <h2>Our Story & Ethos</h2>
    <p>
      Every great solution starts with a tiny problem. For us (team led by <strong>Yogender Gaur Chartered Engineer, HVAC Consultant)</strong>,
      life under traditional air conditioning revealed more stress, unhealthy living conditions in enclosed 
      premises than comfort. The close loop systems, resulting in very poor IAQ and signals towards an imbalance between technology and nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refrigerant cooling machines has been sold in APAC region are basically cooling machines and not air condioners.
      Spreading awareness among citizens at large about health issues at institutional setups is one our key ideology.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are into consultancy and implementation of healthy A/C which gives uniform temperature 
      throughout the year in tropical areas, maintaining oxygen (प्राण वायु) in closed premises, 
      be it Board rooms, Bed rooms or IT workspaces. Rather than conventional (an astonishing 98%) 
      A/C which deplets oxygen level resulting in people left out with very poor Indoor Air Quality (IAQ).
    </p>
    <p>
      With grit, family values, and a relentless belief in harmony with Nature, we engineered the
      <strong>Hybrid Air Cooler</strong>—a system designed not just to cool, but to create
      an <em>ecologically balanced existence</em>. By replacing outdated grass pads with
      clean, sustainable paper, Maruti Energy Efficient Engineers showed that innovation can serve
      both the environment and the local economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Known today as <strong>The Solar King</strong>, Yogender has become a trusted authority in
      <strong>Hotels | Hospitals | IT Parks | Indian Railways | Defence Establishments</strong>,
      proving that cooling can mean more than comfort—it can mean wellbeing, savings, and sustainability.
