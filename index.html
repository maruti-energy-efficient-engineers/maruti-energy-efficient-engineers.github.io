    <h2>Our Story & Ethos</h2>
    <p>
      Every great solution starts with a problem. For Yogender Gaur, life under traditional
      air conditioning revealed more stress, unhealthy living conditions in enclosed premises than comfort. The closed systems,
      artificial air, and rising energy costs were signs of an imbalance between technology and nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      With grit, family values, and a relentless belief in harmony, Gaur engineered the
      <strong>Hybrid Air Cooler</strong>—a system designed not just to cool, but to create
      an <em>ecologically balanced existence</em>. By replacing outdated grass pads with
      clean, sustainable paper, Maruti Energy Efficient Engineers showed that innovation can serve
      both the environment and the local economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Known today as <strong>The Solar King</strong>, Yogender has become a trusted authority in
      <strong>Hotels | Hospitals | IT Parks | Indian Railways | Defence Establishments</strong>,
      proving that cooling can mean more than comfort—it can mean wellbeing, savings, and sustainability.
